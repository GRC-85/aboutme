		    My name is Gregory Chapin and I live in Cleveland, Ohio. I am thirty-one years old and was born and raised in"The Land".
			I currently live in the Detroit-Shoreway neighborhood of Cleveland, a great area that is very walkable with lots of bars and restaurants nearby.
			My favorite thing about the neighborhood is its close proximity to Edgewater Park. I love going to for runs through the park and visiting the beach in the summer months
			I am currently enrolled in "Cleveland Codes" Software Developers Academy at Tri-C and am looking forward to starting a career in software development upon completion of the course.
			I bartend on the weekends at a place called Melt Bar and Grilled.</p>
        
		<p> I haven't got much free time lately, but when I have time to spare I like to keep busy trying new and different things. Some of my favorite hobbies include cooking and eating, staying active outdoors, 
		and going to the gym. I love going to baseball games at Progressive Field. My favorite thing to do above all is traveling to new and exciting places. </p>
